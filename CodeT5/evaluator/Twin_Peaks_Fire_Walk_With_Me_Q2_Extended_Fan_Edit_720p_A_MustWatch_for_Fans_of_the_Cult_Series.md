In 1992, Lynch released a prequel film to the series, titled Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, which depicts the last seven days of Laura's life before her death. The film was met with mixed reviews from critics and fans alike, who found it too dark, violent, and confusing compared to the TV show. However, over time, the film has gained a cult following and appreciation for its artistic merits and deeper exploration of Laura's character and the mythology of Twin Peaks.
 
One of the reasons why the film was so divisive was that Lynch had to cut out a lot of footage to fit the theatrical running time. The original cut of the film was over three hours long, and included scenes that featured characters and subplots from the TV show that were omitted from the final version. Some of these scenes were later released as deleted scenes in various DVD and Blu-ray editions of the film.
 
In 2014, a fan editor known as Q2 released an extended fan edit of the film, titled Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me Q2 Extended Fan Edit 720p. This fan edit restores most of the deleted scenes back into the film, creating a more complete and satisfying experience for fans of the series. The fan edit also improves the picture quality and sound design of the film, making it more enjoyable to watch on modern devices.
 
If you are a fan of Twin Peaks and want to see the film as Lynch originally intended it, you should definitely check out Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me Q2 Extended Fan Edit 720p.

It is a dark, disturbing, and challenging piece of cinema that will haunt you for days. But if you are willing to take the journey into the heart of darkness that is Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me Q2 Extended Fan Edit 720p, you will be rewarded with a masterpiece that will enrich your understanding and appreciation of one of the greatest TV shows ever made.
  
One of the most notable aspects of Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me Q2 Extended Fan Edit 720p is the inclusion of scenes that feature FBI agents Chester Desmond and Sam Stanley, played by Chris Isaak and Kiefer Sutherland, respectively. These scenes were part of the original opening of the film, which showed the investigation of another murder case that was connected to Laura's. These scenes add more mystery and intrigue to the film, as well as some humor and charm from the charismatic performances of Isaak and Sutherland.
 
Another important addition to the fan edit is the scene where Laura visits the Black Lodge, a mysterious and sinister dimension that plays a key role in the mythology of Twin Peaks. In this scene, Laura encounters some of the iconic characters from the TV show, such as The Man from Another Place, The Giant, and BOB, who reveal some clues and secrets about her fate. This scene is crucial for understanding the connection between Laura and the supernatural forces that haunt Twin Peaks, as well as foreshadowing some of the events that would happen in the third season of the series, which was released in 2017.
 
Finally, one of the most emotional and satisfying scenes that is restored in Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me Q2 Extended Fan Edit 720p is the scene where Laura sees her angel in the train car where she is killed. In the TV show, Laura tells her best friend Donna that she had a dream where she saw an angel who told her that she would go away someday. In the film, Laura loses her faith in angels and feels abandoned by them. However, in her final moments, she sees her angel again, who gives her a sense of peace and comfort before she dies. This scene is a beautiful and poignant way to end Laura's tragic story, and to show that there is still hope and light in the darkness that surrounds Twin Peaks.
